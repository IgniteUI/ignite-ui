# Overview  
Ignite UI OSS version accepts contributions, as long as they follow the guidelines explained below. When contributing you would have to follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Perform the changes in your fork
3. Create a pull request with your changes and reference the issue you're working on

Your pull request will undergo a review and if approved will be merged. All checks for the pull request should pass before a pull request is merged.

In order to perform all the necessary checks before pulling your changes in, you need to run  

    npm install
    grunt verify

# Workflow
When working on an issue for the Ignite UI repository, you need to be aware of and to follow a correct status workflow. We have created a number of status labels in order to communicate well what the current status of a single issue/pull request is. The statuses are as follows:

## Development - applicable to issues and pull requests
1. `status: in-review` this is the initial status of an issue. If the label is not placed, go ahead and place it.
2. `status: in-development` this is the status once you start working on an issue. Assign the issue to yourself if it hasn't been assigned already and remove the previous status and assign it an in development status.
3. `status: by-design` this is the status of an issue that has been reviewed and has been determined that the current design of the feature is such that the issue describes the correct behavior as incorrect. Remove other statuses and place this status if you've reviewed the issue.
4. `status: third-party-issue` this is the status of an issue that has been reviewed, has been determined to be an issue, but the root case is not in the Ignite UI code. Example would be browser specific bugs caused by the particular browser's rendering or JavaScript engines. Remove other statuses and place only this one if you're the one performing the investigation.
5. `status: not-to-fix` this is the status of issues that derive from our code, but have been decided to leave as is. This is done when fixes require general design and/or architecture changes and are very risky.
6. `status: duplicate` this is the status of issues that are duplicates of another issue. When applying the duplicate status, make sure to reference the duplicated issue in a comment.
7. `status: resolved` apply this status once you've resolved the issue you're working on and you have an open pull request to all applicable branches.

## Testing - applicable to pull requests
1. `status: awaiting-test` this is the initial status of pull requests. If you're performing the pull request, please place this status on it. Pull requests are accepted if and only if all status checks pass, review is performed, and the pull request has been tested and contains `status: verified`.
2. `status: in-test` place this status once you pick up the pull request for testing.
3. `status: verified` place this status once you've tested the pull request, have verified that the issue is fixed, and have included all necessary automated tests for the issue.
4. `status: not-fixed` place this status once you've tested the pull request and you are still able to reproduce the issue it's attempting to fix. Then assign the developer back on the pull request.

## Localization - applicable to issues and pull requests
1. `status: pending-localization` this status tells that there are changes in the localization strings that need to be translated. When you make such changes, put this status badge without removing the other applicable ones and assign a person to do the translations.
2. `status: localized` this status is for issues that were with a pending translation status and have already been localized. Place this status label once these translation changes have been included in the current pull request, or the changes are already pulled with a different pull request.

# Fixing a bug  
When fixing a bug you need to follow these guidelines:

1. Leave a comment above your change in the format `<initials> <date> <Issue Number|Issue Link> <Comment for the change>`
   * e.g. `K.D. June 28th, 2016 #1234 Adding this comment as an example`
   * e.g. `K.D. June 28th, 2016 https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui/issues/1234 Adding this comment as an example`
2. Write unit tests that cover your change. The test should fail prior to your change and pass after it
3. Run JSHint, JSCS, Unit tests and make sure they all pass
4. Pull request your changes and reference the issue. Use the following title/description format.
   * Title: `<Issue Number> <Change Title>` Description: `closes <Issue Number> <Longer Description>`
   * e.g. Title: `#123 Changing foo to bar` Description: `closes #123`
5. Don't forget to make the necessary status updates, as described in the workflow section.

When bug fixes are applicable to multiple branches, there will be additional steps between 3 and 4. So if letâ€™s say we have a 16.2, 17.1, and a master branch the process will look like this:

1.	If the bug is in 16.2, then switch the branch your branching from to 16.2. For code example purposes let's say the new branch is called `fixing-bug-162`.
2.	Commit your changes to your `fixing-bug-162` branch.
3.	Push and PR to the 16.2 branch.
4.	Switch to the 17.1 branch.
5.  Create a new branch.  For code example purposes let's say the new branch is called `fixing-bug-171`.
6.  Cherry pick your commit from the `fixing-bug-162` branch: `git cherry-pick fixing-bug-162`
7.  Push to your `fixing-bug-171` branch and PR to the 17.1 branch.
8.	Repeat steps 4-7 for all other applicable branches including `master`.

# New feature development
In order to contribute code to a new feature, you need to follow these guidelines.

1. Work on implementation in your fork
2. Follow a test-driven development process (TDD) to ensure full code coverage, or make sure that you include unit tests that cover all of the newly added code
3. Document all newly added public methods, events, and options [Documentation Guideline](https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui/wiki/API-Documentation-Guidelines)
4. Make sure all static code analysis and unit tests pass before opening a pull request
5. Reference the issue you've been working on in your pull request
6. Don't forget to make the necessary status updates, as described in the workflow section.

# Testing a PR
In order to test a pull request that is awaiting test, perform the following actions.

1. Checkout the master branch locally. *Depending on the PR target this can also be a version branch.*
2. Verify that the issue describes correctly the current behavior of the feature/control.
3. If you reproduce the issue, checkout the pull request locally.

  Replace the `<PULL_ID>` with the respective pull number in the following:
  ```bash
  git fetch IgniteUI +refs/pull/<PULL_ID>/merge
  git checkout -qf FETCH_HEAD
  ```
  > Note that the above assumes the remote for this repo is "IgniteUI" but "https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui.git" can be used as well. This uses a detached and temporary ref to quickly get PR merged state the same as the CI builds so there's no branch to dispose of after switching away. If you do want to make some changes, consider creating a branch from the pull request one or check out the [Checking out pull requests locally](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/) article.
4. Verify that the expected behavior is observed with the changes in the pull request.
5. Return the pull request in a not fixed state if you're still reproducing the issue.
6. Don't forget to make the necessary status updates, as described in the workflow section.
